# GoCal: Calculations CLI on the GO

It's simple. This is a CLI calculator that allows for addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division. The program takes 3 command line arguments, like so:
- ./GoCalc 1 2 (add/subtract/multiply/divide)

This program allows for Float64 numbers so all major calculations can be performed.
